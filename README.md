# Lights Out - Discord Bot

## How to use

This is a simple Discord bot I made in two days, attempting to recreate the popular minigame Lights Out.

To start a game, send `s!start` or `s!start <size of playing field>` in a channel called `#lights-out` or `#bot-commands`.

As of right now, the game has no AFK period and the bot cannot run multiple games simultaneously, so administrators can use the command `s!end` to terminate the game if necessary.

Your goal is to turn all the tiles white, while always flipping the tile you're standing on and the tiles adjacent.

I might make it more customizable and add more features in the future.
