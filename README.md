## Lights Out - Discord Bot
This is a simple Discord bot I made in two days, attempting to recreate the popular minigame Lights Out.

To start a game, send "s!start_local_game" in a channel called #lights-out.
Your goal is to turn all the tiles white, while always flipping the tile you're standing on and the tiles adjacent.

I might make it more customizable and add more features in the future.
