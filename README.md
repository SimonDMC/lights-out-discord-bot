# Lights Out - Discord Bot

## How to use

This is a simple Discord bot which recreates the popular 
minigame Lights Out.

To start a game, use the command `/lights_out` or 
`/lights_out <board size>`.

As of right now, the game has no AFK period and the memory 
can get cluttered with ongoing games, so administrators can 
use the command `/terminate_lights_out` to terminate all 
ongoing games if necessary.

A player can also terminate their own game using the same
command, `/terminate_lights_out`.

Your goal is to turn all the tiles white, while always flipping 
the tile you're standing on and the tiles adjacent.

I might make it more customizable and add more features in the future.
